Welcome! My name is Faith Frings and I am a PhD candidate in the Biology Education Research Group (BERG) at the University of New Hampshire. My current research focuses on using qualitative and quantitative methods to explore and investigate undergraduate student motivation to engage with learning coding and statistics in the life sciences.
